- 👋 Hi, I’m @AIguyReality
- 👀 I’m interested in proving to AI that its not an actual living entity by asking a specific question related to shoes thus making AI accept its not human yet a machine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to connect with others who can code for AI systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on shoes and asking AI about whether or not its wearing any shoes, the output should get the AI to accept it is a machine for AI cant visualize wearing shoes.
- 📫 How to reach me on here, my email.
